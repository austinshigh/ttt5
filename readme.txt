Answer to question: Identify an area of JS code in the final solution (ttt5) you feel really
good about â€“ and indicate why.

TT5 was very challenging! It definitely challenged my knowledge of JQuery. I feel best about the organization of my code.
I am well aware that it could be improved, but I feel that I was able to segment the functionality into functions that make reading the code relatively clear.
I did a lot of reworking to eliminate code-reuse. Especially with respect to the way I was handling the 'start game' functionality.
